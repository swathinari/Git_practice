# Git_practice
am just practicing git commands. its just practical implementation.
Git push Command
It is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is an act of transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. 
CI n MR Changes.
in MR componets only we will test QL1,QL2,QL3
git commint
git review +2
with the help of jenkins it goes to CI(db Component)
if the RIU status is green then automatically it will promote into MR
In MR we have rounds, ora_scratch->fresh install in fresh lab. noteste means- commited things that we have changed. test means robot testcase.
